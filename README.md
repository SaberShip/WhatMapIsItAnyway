# RimWorld WhatMapIsItAnyway Mod
## What does it do:
- When you hover over an event letter or ticker message (top left) the relevant map section of the colonist bar will highlight to give you context.
- It can even tell you which map a wanderer may join on and it even works with Vanilla Events Expanded!
- When hovering over a colony on the world map, it will also highlight the colonist bar section corresponding to that colony.
- When opening the colonist bill restriction drop down, it is now organized by map which helps with large colonies.
- Lastly it allows you to filter the "Assignments window" down to colonists on the currently visible map.

## Requires
