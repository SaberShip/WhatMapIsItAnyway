# RimWorld: WhatMapIsItAnyway
## Have you ever:
- Received an event like a ColdSnap or Eclipse, then search your colonies to figure out what map it is on?
- Wondered what map of yours the wanderer will join on?
- Forgotten which of your colonies corresponds to the icon on the world map?
- Wondered why the colonist assignment or bill restriction GUIs don't filter colonists to the current map?
This mod is for you!
	  
## How does it behave:
Similarly to how Pawns in the colonist bar highlight when hovering over events/alerts.
This mod will put a white highlight box around the group of pawns associated with the map affected by the alert or event when you hover your mouse over event letters and alert items on the right.
It also supports highlighting when hovering over ticker notifications on the top left!
Lastly, the colonist restriction in the bill configuration and the colonist list in the assign tab now only display pawns in the current map. 

## How does it work:
This mod patches base functionality of a couple quest generators and incident workers. Therefore, provided other mods do not also change this behavior fundamentally, they should remain compatible

## Compatible with:
- Vanilla Events Expanded
- [LTO] Colony Groups
