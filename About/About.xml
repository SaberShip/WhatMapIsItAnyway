  <description>What does it do:
Ever receive an event, like a ColdSnap or Eclipse, and have to search your colonies to figure out what map it is on?
This mod fixes that!
	  
How does it behave:
Similarly to how Pawns in the colonist bar highlight when overing over events/alerts that affect one or more pawns!
Except this mod will put a white box around the group of pawns associated with the affected map.
This mod adds the highlighting to the colonist bar when you hover the mouse over event letters and alert readout items on the right.
It also adds the highlighting when hovering over ticker notifications on the top left!

How does it work:
This mod patches base functionality of a couple quest generators and incident workers. Therefore, provided other mods do not also change this behavior, they should remain compatible
For example, Vanilla Events Expanded is compatible! (Atleast at the time of this mod's release)
